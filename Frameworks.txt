🗂️ Core Topics for TeachMeAI.in Framework

1. Self-Learning Foundations
	•	Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) – goal setting, monitoring, reflection, adaptation
	•	Master Adaptive Learner (MAL) model
	•	Andragogy (adult learning principles, Knowles)
	•	Psychological Capital (hope, resilience, efficacy, optimism)
	•	Motivation theories (Intrinsic vs Extrinsic, Self-Determination Theory)
	•	Reflection & Metacognition habits

2. Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)
	•	Note-taking systems (Zettelkasten, PARA, Second Brain)
	•	Knowledge capture & curation workflows
	•	Sensemaking practices (maps, synthesis, storytelling)
	•	AI-assisted PKM (NotebookLM, Obsidian + AI, etc.)
	•	Digital minimalism & attention management

3. Mentoring Models
	•	Traditional 1:1 mentoring
	•	Self-Mentoring (emerging trend)
	•	Micro-mentoring (short, focused bursts)
	•	Reverse mentoring (junior → senior, esp. tech)
	•	Mutual mentoring (two-way value exchange)
	•	Group mentoring / mentoring circles (for reference)
	•	AI-augmented mentoring (matching, reflection scaffolding, assistants)

4. Learner Typologies & Styles
	•	Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle + Honey & Mumford’s 4 styles
	•	VARK model (Visual, Auditory, Reading/Writing, Kinesthetic — for preference)
	•	Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition (Novice → Expert)
	•	Learning preferences vs evidence (what’s useful, what’s myth)

5. Frameworks & Roadmaps
	•	IMPACT Framework (Iterative coaching cycle: Initiate → Map → Prioritize → Act → Consolidate → Transition)
	•	Capability Academies (capability > courses)
	•	70:20:10 Learning Model (formal vs informal vs experiential learning)
	•	AFERR (Activation–Forecast–Experiment–Realization–Reflection)
	•	ADAPT & TTI frameworks (innovation & transformation) — when contextualizing AI adoption

6. AI in Learning & Mentoring
	•	GenAI for self-learning (roadmap generation, summarization, questioning)
	•	AI as co-pilot in mentoring (resource finder, reflection prompts)
	•	Risks: bias, over-reliance, hallucination → role of human mentor
	•	Tools landscape: ChatGPT, Gemini, NotebookLM, WebLLM, Flowise, Ollama

7. Designing Self-Learning Pathways
	•	Intake diagnostics (Profile, Aspirations, Pains, Gains)
	•	Scales & indices (SRL Index, Confidence Index, Time Friction score)
	•	Personalization by learner type (Theorist vs Pragmatist etc.)
	•	30/60/90-day action planning
	•	Reflection prompts & tracking dashboards

8. Impact & Measurement
	•	KPIs (learning, work, artifacts, confidence)
	•	Micro-artifacts (prompt pack, SOP, demo)
	•	ROI of short-cycle learning engagements
	•	Transition pathways (independent growth vs deeper mentoring)



IMPACT as the Core Framework
1. Intake → IMPACT Mapping

I – Initiate Assessment
Intake form responses (Profile, Aspirations, Pains, Gains, Learner Type, Skill Stage) = Client Profile & Focus Areas.

M – Map Opportunities
Agent analyzes responses + role/industry → shortlist 2–3 AI use cases/workflows directly relevant to the client.

P – Prioritize Actions
Agent weighs motivation, time friction, and skill stage → 1–2 realistic first steps with specific tools + timeline.

A – Act & Adjust
Suggest first tasks / hands-on trials (aligned to learner type e.g. Pragmatist = problem-first mini project). Propose feedback loops (weekly check-in or async reflection prompts).

C – Consolidate Learning
Provide reflection prompts and a short synthesis of what success/struggles reveal. Reinforce confidence + habits.

T – Transition Forward
Outline what’s next: further learning resources, community links, next 30–60–90 roadmap, or follow-up service.

2. Analysis & Output Structure

When the custom agent processes a user’s intake, it should always output in this structure:

Initiate Assessment

Client Snapshot (Profile, Learner Type, Motivation, SRL index, Dreyfus stage)

Top 2–3 Focus Areas

Map Opportunities

List 2–3 AI opportunities in their work/life context

Note why each matches profile & aspirations

Prioritize Actions

Recommended 1–2 first steps (tools, workflows, weekly time commitment)

Quick wins vs. long-term goals

Act & Adjust

First assignment/practice (hands-on)

Reflection questions / progress tracker outline

Consolidate Learning

Key takeaways (skills gained, habits formed)

Confidence/competence uplift

Transition Forward

Next steps (independent learning, curated resources, or extended program)

Suggested mentoring cadence
