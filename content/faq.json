    "question": "What frameworks do you use for AI adoption?",
    "answer": "I use proven frameworks like IMPACT (Identify, Map, Pilot, Assess, Commit, Transform) for systematic AI integration and ADAPT (Assess, Design, Apply, Practice, Transform) for skill development. These ensure measurable progress rather than random experimentation."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is this different from generic AI courses?",
    "answer": "Instead of one-size-fits-all content, I use the IMPACT framework to create personalized roadmaps. We start with your specific role and challenges, then build a structured 30-90 day plan with clear milestones and accountability checkpoints."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens in the 70-minute Clarity Call?",
    "answer": "We follow the ASSESS phase: evaluate your current AI readiness, identify immediate opportunities in your workflow, and create a one-page action plan using the IMPACT methodology. You'll get specific tool recommendations and quick-win tactics you can implement immediately."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you ensure real results, not just theory?",
    "answer": "The ADAPT framework emphasizes hands-on practice. Every session includes guided tool usage, real-world applications to your work, and measurable outcomes. We track progress through KPIs and adjust the approach based on what's actually working for you."
  },
  {
    "question": "What if I'm completely new to AI?",
    "answer": "Perfect! The IMPACT framework is designed for all levels. We start with the IDENTIFY phase to understand your goals, then MAP the simplest path forward. No technical background neededâ€”just curiosity and willingness to practice."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you measure success in the programs?",
    "answer": "Using the TRANSFORM phase metrics: confidence levels (1-10 scale), tool adoption rate, time saved per week, and specific work outcomes. For professionals, we track career impact. For educators, student engagement improvements. All measurable, not subjective."
  },
  {
    "question": "What's your refund policy?",
    "answer": "Full refund if cancelled 24 hours before the session. If you're not satisfied after the first session, we'll work together to adjust the approach or provide a full refund. The frameworks are proven, but fit matters."
