# TeachMeAI — Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Owner**: Irfan Khalid  
**Version**: v2.9.0 (INTELLIGENCE UPGRADE)  
**Status**: 🟢 LIVE IN PRODUCTION

---

## 1. Executive Summary
TeachMeAI is a professional AI adoption platform that moves learners from "AI curiosity" to "AI mastery" in 30–90 days. The platform features an **Agentic Intake Engine** ("Coach-in-a-Box") that automates lead qualification, psychometric profiling, and the generation of hyper-personalized 90-day roadmaps through a multi-agent hierarchy.

## 2. System Architecture (The "Hybrid" Model)

### 2.1 Cross-Domain Handshake
The platform operates across two primary domains with a secure JSON Web Token (JWT) handshake:
1.  **Home Site (`teachmeai-home-site`)**: Conversion-focused landing page (Vercel).
2.  **Intake App (`teachmeai-intake-app`)**: Deep-assessment conversational interface (Vercel).
3.  **Agent Service**: Backend orchestration layer (Google Cloud Run).

**The Handshake Flow**:
- User starts challenge intake on Home Site.
- Home Site signs a JWT containing `name`, `email`, and `challenge`.
- User is redirected to `intake.teachmeai.in?token=...`.
- Intake App verifies token and pre-fills session state for a seamless transition.

## 3. The Intelligence Hierarchy (Agent Service)
The `agent-service` is a Genkit-powered Express application that manages a 6-agent choreography:

1.  **The Guide**: Manages initial conversational extraction and lead capture.
2.  **The Profiler**: Performs expert psychometric analysis (Decision style, Uncertainty handling, Cognitive load tolerance).
3.  **Learner Dimensions**: Assesses 5 key areas: SRL (Self-Regulated Learning), Motivation, Preferences (VARK), Readiness, and Constraints.
4.  **Deep Research**: Maps industry-specific AI opportunities and identifies "Quick Win" portfolio artifacts.
5.  **The Strategist**: Calibrates raw goals into outcome-focused IMPACT goals.
6.  **The Tactician**: Assembles a weekly execution plan (Act/Check/Transform) calibrated to time and skill barriers.

## 4. Hyper-Personalization Logic (v2.9.0)
The system adapts the output dynamically based on four core "Pivots":

- **Seniority Pivot**: 
  - *Junior*: Focus on task-level automation and individual efficiency.
  - *Senior/Lead*: Focus on strategic leverage, team scaling, and decision support.
- **Technical Pivot (Digital Mastery)**: 
  - *Score < 3*: Suggests simple, web-based tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity).
  - *Score >= 4*: Suggests automation, APIs, custom Python scripts, and LangChain.
- **Time Calibration**: 
  - Roadmaps are time-fenced. If availability < 120m/week, sessions are 20-min "Sprints."
- **Learning Style Pivot (Kolb)**: 
  - *Activists/Pragmatists*: Start with "Building" tasks.
  - *Theorists/Reflectors*: Start with "Researching" tasks.
